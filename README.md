## Mini homework - 2018/02/19

**Question**
Why are we using postgresql database  instead of sqlite ?

**(My) Answer**
Because;
  - sqlite doesn't support User Management
  - sqLite only allows one user to write to the dateabase at a time.
  - is best suited for embedded aplications and/or single user local used apps.
  - "postgresql is the most advanced Object-based Relation Database Management System which uses Object, Classes, and Inheritance." - nuff said ;)
